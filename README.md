# Mroccan-Paths--H
A website that provides essential services for tourists, including information on destinations, transport options, and travel planning. It also features a review section where users can share their experiences about places and services to help others make informed decisions.

In this project, I used React, Firebase, jQuery, and CSS to build a seamless and user-friendly interface. The platform also includes the possibility to contact people directly via their WhatsApp or email for personalized assistance.
